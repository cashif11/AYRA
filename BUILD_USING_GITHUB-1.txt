📱 BUILD APK USING GITHUB ON YOUR VIVO PHONE
=============================================

GREAT NEWS! You can use GitHub to build APK automatically!

GitHub will build it for FREE using GitHub Actions.
You just need to:
1. Upload files to GitHub
2. Wait 15 minutes
3. Download the APK
4. Install on phone

That's it!


STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE
==================


STEP 1: Create GitHub Account (If you don't have)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

On your Vivo phone:
1. Open browser (Chrome)
2. Go to: https://github.com
3. Click "Sign up"
4. Enter email address
5. Create password
6. Verify email (check your email inbox)
7. Done! ✅

(If you already have GitHub account, skip to STEP 2)


STEP 2: Create New Repository
──────────────────────────────

On GitHub (in your browser):

1. Click "+" icon (top right)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Give it a name:
   → Name: "ai-studio-pro"
4. Description (optional):
   → "AI chatbot app with Gemini"
5. Select "Public" (recommended)
6. Click "Create repository"

You'll see empty repository page.


STEP 3: Upload the ZIP File
────────────────────────────

On GitHub repository page:

1. Click "Add file" (green button)
2. Click "Upload files"
3. Click "Choose your files" or drag and drop
4. Select: ai_studio_pro_complete.zip
5. Wait for upload (might take 1 minute)
6. At bottom, click "Commit changes"
7. Click "Commit changes" again

GitHub now has your files!


STEP 4: Extract/Unzip the Files
─────────────────────────────────

Now you need to unzip the file on GitHub:

1. In your repository, find: ai_studio_pro_complete.zip
2. Click on it
3. GitHub will show contents
4. But we need the actual files, not ZIP

Actually, let's upload the folder instead:

Go back and:
1. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
2. Extract ai_studio_pro_complete.zip first (on your phone)
3. Upload the ai_studio_pro folder directly
4. Upload all files inside it

OR use this simpler method:
→ Skip this step, upload ZIP, we'll handle it


STEP 5: Add GitHub Actions Build Workflow
──────────────────────────────────────────

This is what builds your APK automatically!

In GitHub:
1. Click "Add file"
2. Click "Create new file"
3. Name it: .github/workflows/build-apk.yml
4. Copy-paste this content:

---BEGIN CODE---
